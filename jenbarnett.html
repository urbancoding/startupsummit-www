        <p>Jen Barnett worked in advertising for ten years, creating and executing marketing campaigns for the Bruno's,
          Food City, and IGA supermarket chains. She began working in digital strategy in 2000 for companies like
          Goody's Family Clothing, CookingLight.com, Turner Broadcasting Group, and many others. She has an MBA from
          Emory University's Goizueta Business School with concentrations in marketing and innovation. While there, she
          developed a thesis on the economics of obesity that led to her interest in circumventing the industrialized
          food system.</p>

        <p>Jen and Sam developed Freshfully because they shared an interest in buying and cooking healthy local foods,
          but had a hard time finding sources. They funded the company with a prize from the Incubate(bang!)
          challenge.</p>
