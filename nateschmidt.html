          Nate brought his online marketing skills to the South after meeting his Birmingham-born wife in
          law school. No rookie to the world of online deals and local business, he’s been providing
          creative couponing solutions for restaurants across the nation for over a decade. When he’s
          not at Deal Co-op HQ, he’s chasing around his twin sons and/or their older brother. He’s the
          reigning office cornhole champion (disputed).
