        <p>Sam Brasseale holds a BFA in graphic design and new media from the University of Montevallo. He began
          developing UI in high school, and has worked in front-end development for Intermark, Infomedia, and
          VisitSouth.com. He specializes in graphic design and PHP development of multi-user content systems. He manages
          all technical aspects at Freshfully, including POS, inventory management, web development, and much more.
        </p>

        <p>Jen and Sam developed Freshfully because they shared an interest in buying and cooking healthy local foods,
          but had a hard time finding sources. They funded the company with a prize from the Incubate(bang!)
          challenge.</p>
